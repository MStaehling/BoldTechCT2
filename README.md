Create a simple (no fancy design necessary) website with two unordered lists. Populate the lists with

addresses retrieved via the Google Geocode API. Specifically each list item should only display the

“formatted_address” component of the address object. Additionally the first list should only contain

addresses that have a zip code and the second list should only contain addresses that don’t have a zip

code.
